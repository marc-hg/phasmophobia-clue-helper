# PhasmophobiaGhosts

Unofficial phasmophobia(a videogame) website to help players identify the ghost more easily and provide useful information about the ghost as well 

This is a very small program I made for myself and it's been helping me a lot when playing so I thought I'd share it here

Basically you can filter all the possible ghosts based on whatever clues you know, so if you have two clues and all that's left is 2 ghosts you can throw any clue but those two out of the window




(it's pwa so you can install it on your phone or pc too)


## TODO:
1. Add a third state to the checks you can filter out clues that you know/guess are **not** in the current game (for example you've been talking to the spirit box for half an hour but gotten no response whatsoever)
2. Add more ghosts
3. Implement app testing (karma tests are empty)
